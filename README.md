# Personal Library

Made from freeCodeCamp.org's boilerplate for the Personal Library project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/personal-library

You can choose port (write PORT=*your port here*) and allow testing on startup (write NODE_ENV=test) through an .env file.

You'll need to add a valid MongoDB URI string as the MONGO_URI variable in the .env if you want it to work.

(Frontend is almost unmodified from the one provided by freeCodeCamp for testing)
